**Pet Adoption Centre NZ**

Project Overview 

I have created a web-based application for easy Pet Adoption. Information regarding Pets and their status is logged in this web-site. To have a easy and user friendly interface, I have used Entity Framework Core MVC.

Repository Contents

 - Different Standards code is developed
 - Recorded on the challenges encountered and the process of resolving these issues.

Hardware Requirement

 - Windows 10 running Visual Studio 2022.NET 8.0 or above

Operating Guidelines

1. Replicate Repository
2. To set up database, run the "update-database" command in Package Manager Console in Visual Studio to apply migration to the Visual Studio SQL Server database.
3. Next, in Visual Studio we Build the solution. This enables the application to be launced.
4. The functionality of web application is developed for customers/admin to manage the Pet adoption process.
5. Users can assign pets to specific breeds and shelters upon creation and then choose to adopt them out or leave them for the next person who signs up an account with us.
6. Next is creating new records; Navigate Pet and click "Create New" to create a new pet or "Adopt" from the given list and pet status will automatically change.
7. Navigate to Breeds and click "Create New", this is optional, to allow a new breed into the shelters.
8. Same steps to be followed for the other two tables, Location and Shelters.


Note: As of now, Foreign Key ID fields will be changed in future to string fields, preferable dropdown , for better user experience
